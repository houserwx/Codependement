# Multi-Agent System Integration

The CoDependement VS Code extension now includes a sophisticated multi-agent system that automatically coordinates specialized AI agents to handle complex development tasks.

## ü§ñ Available Agents

### 1. **Planner Agent**
- **Role**: Task breakdown and architecture planning
- **Triggers**: Complex implementation requests, project setup
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Analyzes requirements and creates execution plans
  - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
  - Assigns appropriate agents to each subtask

### 2. **Coder Agent**
- **Role**: Code implementation and development
- **Triggers**: Function creation, class implementation, API development
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generates code implementations
  - Creates project structures
  - Implements algorithms and logic

### 3. **Debugger Agent**
- **Role**: Issue identification and bug fixing
- **Triggers**: Error resolution, performance optimization
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifies runtime errors and logic issues
  - Finds performance bottlenecks
  - Detects memory leaks and resource problems

### 4. **Tester Agent**
- **Role**: Test creation and validation
- **Triggers**: Testing requests, quality assurance
- **Capabilities**:
  - Designs comprehensive test cases
  - Implements unit and integration tests
  - Validates functionality and reports coverage

### 5. **Documenter Agent**
- **Role**: Documentation creation and maintenance
- **Triggers**: Documentation requests, API documentation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Creates technical documentation
  - Generates API references and usage guides
  - Produces implementation explanations

## üöÄ How It Works

### Automatic Activation
The multi-agent system automatically activates when it detects complex, multi-step requests:

**Examples of Multi-Agent Triggers:**
- "Implement a complete authentication system"
- "Create a full REST API with testing"
- "Build a React component with documentation"
- "Design and implement a database schema"
- "Develop a complete feature end-to-end"

### Task Flow
1. **Planning Phase**: Planner Agent analyzes the request and creates subtasks
2. **Execution Phase**: Specialized agents execute subtasks in priority order
3. **Coordination**: Results are coordinated and integrated
4. **Reporting**: Comprehensive results are presented to the user

### Priority System
Tasks are executed based on priority:
- **High**: Critical implementation tasks
- **Medium**: Supporting functionality and tests  
- **Low**: Documentation and optimization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### VS Code Settings

```json
{
  "codependent.enableMultiAgent": true,
  "codependent.agentCollaboration": "sequential",
  "codependent.multiAgentThreshold": "medium"
}
```

#### Settings Explained:
- **enableMultiAgent**: Enable/disable multi-agent processing
- **agentCollaboration**: How agents work together:
  - `sequential`: Agents work one after another (default)
  - `parallel`: Agents work simultaneously when possible
  - `hierarchical`: Agents work in a strict hierarchy
- **multiAgentThreshold**: Complexity level that triggers multi-agent:
  - `low`: Most requests use multi-agent
  - `medium`: Complex requests use multi-agent (default)
  - `high`: Only very complex requests use multi-agent

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Authentication System
**User Request:**
```
"Implement a complete JWT authentication system with user registration, login, and protected routes"
```

**Multi-Agent Response:**
```
ü§ñ Multi-Agent Processing Initiated

[PLANNER] ‚úÖ
Task broken down into 5 subtasks:
1. Analyze requirements and design architecture (coder)
2. Implement core functionality (coder)  
3. Create unit tests (tester)
4. Debug and fix issues (debugger)
5. Create documentation (documenter)

[CODER] ‚úÖ
Generated authentication system implementation...

[TESTER] ‚úÖ
Testing completed: 12 tests run, 11 passed, 1 failed, 85% coverage

[DEBUGGER] ‚úÖ
Debugged: JWT token validation - Fixed expiration handling issue

[DOCUMENTER] ‚úÖ
Documentation created with API Reference, Usage Examples, Security Guide
```

### Example 2: React Component
**User Request:**
```
"Create a reusable React form component with validation and testing"
```

**Multi-Agent Response:**
```
ü§ñ Multi-Agent Processing Initiated

[PLANNER] ‚úÖ
Task broken down into 4 subtasks:
1. Design component architecture (coder)
2. Implement form component (coder)
3. Create validation tests (tester)  
4. Create usage documentation (documenter)

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands

### Available Commands:
- **CoDependement: Show Multi-Agent Status** - View current agent status and task history
- **CoDependement: Refresh MCP Tools** - Refresh MCP server connections

### Command Palette Usage:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "CoDependement" to see available commands
3. Select the desired multi-agent command

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Agent Status Monitoring
Use the "Show Multi-Agent Status" command to see:
- Currently active tasks
- Agent availability status
- Recent execution history
- Success/failure rates

### Console Logging
Multi-agent activities are logged to the VS Code Developer Console:
- Agent initialization
- Task assignments
- Execution progress
- Error handling

## üîß Integration with Existing Features

### MCP Server Integration
The multi-agent system works seamlessly with MCP servers:
- Agents can use MCP tools for enhanced capabilities
- External tools are automatically available to all agents
- MCP resources are shared across the agent system

### Standard Tool Integration
All existing tools remain available:
- File operations (read, write, create directories)
- Workspace analysis
- Git operations
- Search functionality

## üìà Benefits

### For Simple Tasks
- Single-agent processing for quick operations
- Existing tool functionality preserved
- Fast response times

### For Complex Tasks
- Intelligent task breakdown
- Specialized agent expertise
- Coordinated execution
- Comprehensive results
- Quality assurance through testing
- Automatic documentation

## üö´ Fallback Behavior

If multi-agent processing fails:
1. Error is logged and reported to user
2. System automatically falls back to standard single-agent processing
3. User request is still fulfilled using traditional methods
4. No loss of functionality

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, additional configuration options are available through the workspace settings:

```json
{
  "codependent.multiAgentContext": {
    "projectType": "auto-detect",
    "codeStyle": "enterprise",
    "testingFramework": "jest",
    "documentationStyle": "comprehensive"
  }
}
```

This allows fine-tuning of agent behavior based on project requirements and team preferences.
